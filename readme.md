# Pig Game

This is a simple implementation of the Pig dice game. The game is played in the browser and is written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Game Rules

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their round score.
- But, if the player rolls a 1, all their round score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their round score gets added to their global score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points on the global score wins the game.
